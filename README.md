# AI-Powered Career Guidance & Resume Screening (Prototype)

This project is an academic prototype developed to demonstrate how
Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
can be used for resume screening and basic career guidance.

The system analyzes resume text, compares extracted skills with
job-role requirements, and provides a resume score along with
skill gap recommendations.

---

## Problem Statement
Many students and fresh graduates struggle to create job-relevant resumes
and identify missing skills required for specific job roles. Traditional
career counseling is often expensive, time-consuming, and inaccessible.

This project proposes an AI-based solution to improve employability
through automated resume analysis and personalized guidance.

---

## Features
- Resume skill extraction using NLP (rule-based)
- Job-role-based skill comparison
- Resume scoring
- Identification of missing skills
- Basic career guidance recommendations

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Regular Expressions (Regex)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Google Colab / Local Python Environment

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the `code` folder
3. Run:
python resume_analysis.py

---

## Ethical Considerations
- No personal data storage
- Skill-based evaluation only
- No biased decision-making
- Recommendation-based output

---

## Project Status
This is a **prototype / academic project** and not a production-ready
ATS system. It is intended for learning and demonstration purposes.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real ATS parsing
- Machine learning-based skill matching
- Web application deployment
- Chatbot-based career guidance

---

## SDG Alignment
This project aligns with **SDG 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth**
by supporting employability and skill development.
